# Rice_RNAseq_mGWAS
Codes for transcriptome data analysis and metabolite-based genome-wide association study for rice UV-B stress. Transcriptome sequencing reads of the rice leaves of four rice varieties under UV-B and control conditions were deposited into the NCBI BioProject under the accession numbers PRJNA123160 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1123160). The metabolomic data have been deposited in the OMIX, China National Center for Bioinformation/Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under accession number OMIX006966 (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/omix/release/OMIX006966).
